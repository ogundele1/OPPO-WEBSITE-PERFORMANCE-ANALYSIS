 # OPPO WEBSITE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
 Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. This is a transactional data set that contains all the transactions occurring in online retail. E-commerce data is information relating to the visitors and performance of an online shop. It's mostly used by marketers e.g. in understanding consumer behavior and enhancing conversion funnels.

<br />


<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

OPPO’s management team wants to understand the different factors that contribute to the revenue of the website. Further, the analysis will be a good way for management to understand how customers interact with their website. As a Data Analyst working at Aileadtech consulting firm that has been contracted by OPPO, I was given the task to perform a detailed analysis with the available data as well as a set of recommendations for OPPO. In addition, create a dashboard using Power BI to generate useful insights that will help the OPPO organization to grow its business.</b> 


<h2>ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION</h2>

-  The data contains information on the web sessions of a customer: "Administrative", "Administrative Duration", "Informational", "Informational Duration", "Product Related" and "Product Related Duration". These represent the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and the total time spent in each of these page categories. The values of these features are derived from the URL information of the pages visited by the user and updated in real-time when a user takes an action, e.g. moving from one page to another. <br />

-  The "Bounce Rate", "Exit Rate" and "Page Value" features represent the metrics measured by "Google Analytics" for each page in the e-commerce site.
-  Bounce Rate: The value of the "Bounce Rate" feature for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave ("bounce") without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session.</b>

-  Exit Rate: The value of the "Exit Rate" feature for a specific web page is calculated for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that was the last in the session.</b>

    Dataset has average bounce rates and exit rates for a page a customer lands on. </b>
    
-  Page Value: The "Page Value" feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction.</b>

-  Special Day: The "Special Day" feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Mother’s Day, Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with the transaction.</b>

   The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and the delivery date.</b>
   
-  The dataset also includes the operating system, browser, region, and traffic type - these values are masked.</b>


- VisitorType: returning visitor, new visitor, or other types of customer.</b>

- Weekend: a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is a weekend or not.</b>

- month: month of the year.</b>

<h2>INSIGHTS</h2

<br />


- We observed a significant surge in revenue during the months of November, May, and December.
- The total revenue for the time under consideration is approximately $2M. Product-related pages account for 91.69% of the revenue, Administrative pages contribute 6.95% while the informational page have the lowest contribution of 1.37%. The total revenue is generated from the activities of 12,330 visitors in which  10,551 are returning visitors, 1,694 are new visitors and 85 visitors fall under other which is unclassified group. The website revenue is mostly driven by the returning visitors contributing $1.52M followed by the new visitors accounts for $0.42M while the other group contributed $0.04M to the total revenue.
- The majority of website traffic originates from site 2, contributing $0.95 million to the total revenue. Site 1 also generates significant traffic. In terms of regional contributions, Region 1 leads with revenue of $0.84 million, followed by Region 3 with a contribution of $0.32 million.
- Regarding the bounce rate, 56.12% can be attributed to the “other” group. It’s possible that they accidentally landed on the website, perhaps through an advert link, and didn’t find the landing page content interesting. Following this, returning visitors account for 36.12%. A similar pattern is observed for the exit rate, where the “other” visitors contribute the most (48.53%), followed by returning visitors at 35.63%.
- Considering the bounce rate per visitor from the traffic sites,  Traffic site 1 have the highest bounce rate with majority of this coming from the other group with returning visitors and new visitors also have significant contributions. This is follow by traffic site 10 which contributed by both returning and other visitors. For sites 7,14, 17, 18, 19 the returning visitors  which doesn`t seem right for the business performance on the long run.
- Traffic site 2, 1,3, 4 and 13  account for the traffic to the website. Based on the chart, we can see that traffic sites 8 and 5 have a higher number of new visitors compared to returning visitors. This situation presents a significant growth opportunity for these sites. The data indicates that traffic from majority of unclassified visitors are concentrated here. This presents a significant opportunity to guide them through the visitor journey, transitioning them from the unclassified stage to becoming regular returning visitors.
- From the Visitor per region chart, it is shown that majority of the visitors are from region 1 followed by region 3 and 4 with the returning visitors contributing majorly to the website revenue. The data indicates that the majority of unclassified visitors are concentrated in this region. This presents a significant opportunity to guide them through the visitor journey, transitioning them from the unclassified stage to becoming regular returning visitors.


<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

- Oppo should consider replicating the successful campaigns and activities from November, May, and December in other months, as these significantly boosted revenue.
- When planning activities and campaigns, the focus should be on further driving interest in the product-related pages of the website. Additionally, Oppo should consider introducing a loyalty scheme to encourage visitors to return to the site. 
-  The campaigns and activities should prioritize increasing traffic from both site 2 and site 1, with a specific focus on regions 1 and 3.
-  Oppo should focus on creating captivating and engaging contents for the website landing pages. This will grab visitors’ attention and encourage them to explore further.
